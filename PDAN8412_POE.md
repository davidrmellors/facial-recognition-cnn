**Referencing Rubric**                                                                                                                                                      

Providing evidence based on valid and referenced academic sources is a fundamental educational principle and the cornerstone of high-quality academic work. Part of achieving this quality is referencing in a way that is consistent and congruent with the requirements of the referencing style being used.  

   
Therefore, inconsistent and/or incongruent referencing will result in a penalty of **a maximum of ten percent being deducted from the overall percentage** awarded to your assessment submission. 

    
Please note that **evidence of plagiarism** in the form of copied or unreferenced work, absent reference lists, or exceptionally poor referencing **may result in action being taken in accordance with The IIE’s Intellectual Integrity and Property Rights Policy (IIE023)**. Similarly, **evidence of excessive AI usage may result in action being taken in accordance with The IIE’s Student Conduct, Discipline and Safety Policy (IIE015)**. 

Markers are required to provide feedback to students by **circling/underlining the information in the table below that best describes the student’s work and by adding constructive commentary where appropriate.** The examples provided are not exhaustive but illustrate the errors. 

   
**Deductions** 

* Where the student’s work contains **five or more errors** aligned to the **minor errors column** below, **deduct 5% from the overall percentage.**  

 

* Where the student’s work contains **five or more errors** aligned to the **major errors column** below, **deduct 10% from the overall percentage.**  

 

* **Where both minor and major errors** (e.g. two minor and three major, etc.) are present, **deduct 10% only** (and not 5% or 15%) from the overall percentage.


| Required:   Consistent and congruent referencing   | Minor errors   Deduct 5% from overall percentage.  Example: if the response receives 70%, deduct 5%. The final mark is 65%.  | Major errors   Deduct 10% from the overall percentage.  Example: if the response receives 70%, deduct 10%.  The final mark is 60%.  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Consistency**   The **correct referencing style** for the **discipline** – i.e., either  **Harvard**, OR **APA** (for  Psychology)**,** OR **Law**, OR **IEEE** (for ICT/Engineering) – has been used consistently for all in-text references and in the bibliography/reference list.    **Concepts** and **ideas** that are **quoted** and/or **paraphrased** are referenced consistently throughout.    **Position of the in-text reference**: an in-text reference is positioned consistently where appropriate for every quote and paraphrase.     | **Minor inconsistencies:**  The referencing style used is generally consistent with what is required, but there are one or two changes/errors in the format of in-text referencing and/or in the bibliography/reference list.     For example, page numbers for direct quotes in-text have been provided for one source, but not in another. Or, two book chapters in the bibliography/reference list have been referenced in two different formats. Or, the publication year has been placed after the author name in one bibliography/reference list entry, and after the source title in another, etc.     Concepts and ideas in quotes and/or paraphrases are typically referenced, but a full in-text reference is missing or incomplete from one or two small sections of the work.     Position of the references: in-text references are only given at the beginning and/or end of every paragraph.  | **Major inconsistencies:**  Poor and wholly inconsistent referencing style used in-text and/or in the bibliography/reference list.    Multiple referencing styles for the same source types have been used.    For example, the format for direct quotes in-text and/or book chapters in the bibliography/reference list and/or year of publication in the bibliography/reference list is different across multiple instances.     Concepts and ideas in quotes and/or paraphrases are haphazardly referenced in-text.     Position of the references: in-text references are only given at the beginning or end of large sections of work.   |
| **Feedback on referencing consistency:**        |  |  |
| **Congruency**   **Each source** reflected within **in-text references** is included accurately in the **bibliography/reference list.**  All **bibliography/reference list** entries are in the **required order** for the referencing style used (e.g. alphabetical, alphabetical under subheadings, numerical).  All **direct quotes** and **paraphrases** have been **integrated** **appropriately** into the text using introductory phrases, accurate grammar, etc.     | **Minor incongruences:**   There is largely a match between the sources presented in-text and those in the  bibliography/reference list, but one or two sources that appear in-text do not appear in the  bibliography/reference list, or vice versa. Or key source information is missing from one or two in-text references or bibliography/reference list entries only (e.g. publication year, city of publication, URL date accessed, etc.).    There is a clear and largely accurate ordering of sources in the bibliography/reference list as required by the referencing style used, but with one or two references out of order.     An attempt has been made for source integration into the text using appropriate introductory phrases and grammar, but one or two quotes or paraphrases do not flow as clearly or logically within the sentence structure as they could.  | **Major incongruences:**  No relationship/several incongruencies between the in-text referencing and the bibliography/reference list.     For example, multiple sources are included in-text, but not in the bibliography, and/or vice versa. Key source information is missing from multiple in-text references and/or reference list entries. A URL link, rather than the actual reference, is provided in the bibliography. Sources are repeated in the reference list, etc.     Most sources are listed in a haphazard order throughout the bibliography/reference list.    Few to no appropriate introductory phrases or rules of grammar have been applied, and many direct quotes and/or paraphrases feel disconnected from the flow of the text.      |

| Background  |
| :---- |
|   |
| This portfolio of evidence consists of three parts. Part 1 focuses on Recurrent Neural Networks, Part 2 is about Logistic Regression and model improvement, and the final Portfolio of Evidence submission focuses on image recognition with TensorFlow. This portfolio of evidence will require you to complete additional research.  |

 

| Instructions: 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  |

|   |
| This Portfolio of Evidence requires that you train regression models, classification models and work with text data to meet the outcomes of the briefs given for each part. Please ensure that you:    Complete all your code using Python in a Jupyter Notebook – you can use any IDE of your choice. You need to submit all your notebooks and files   Make use of Markdown to explain your steps and detail your findings. You may use the following cheat sheet to help you: https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet    You are also required to complete a report and submit it along with your analysis. This report needs to be succinct and to the point. No word count is provided; however, overly lengthy submissions will receive a 15% penalty. This report needs to be submitted in PDF format.     While we encourage you to look at many tutorials, YouTube videos and to use LLMs, it is important that your work remains original. It is very easy to spot when a tutorial is overused – there are actually not all that many. Be careful of the notebooks on Kaggle, do not overly rely on them to complete your analysis, as you will be flagged for plagiarism.     As an analyst, and in many cases as a developer, referencing code bases is not uncommon. However, you need to provide code attributions to any code that you have directly taken from a code base (or from an LLM) that is not your own. You are also allowed to only use 20% of this code directly without editing (more than just changing variable names). You can reference the Byte Bot to help you with code attribution and plagiarism: ByteBot    For each task, you will be required to find a large **open data set (Minimum 10 000 records)** that can be used for analysis.     |

Include the link to your data in your submission, and remember that you must include a **reference** to where you found your data. **You may choose a new dataset for each task**. However, **select carefully** so that you can analyse the data using the **required method** in each task. 

 

You must make use of **Spark** for the **analysis** in each part. However, you are **NOT** required to train your model using Spark.  

 

Finally, **all your files need to be submitted on GitHub AND also on ARC.** Your campus will provide you with the necessary GitHub Classroom links. You can also find help on how to submit to GitHub on the ByteBot.  

 

The specific requirements for each part are listed below. 

 

**Tip:** Read the rubric at the end of this document in detail to make sure that you meet all the requirements.

| You are the data analyst for a large book press. As part of your role, you are often asked to create models for FANs to interact with in a fun way. One of the tasks you have been assigned is to create a bot that will guess an author based on writing style.    **Evaluate and justify** the dataset for suitability to apply a **Long-Term Short-Term Recurrent Neural Network**    **Plan your analysis:** It is crucial to get into the habit of planning your analysis before you conduct it. You can use the steps below to guide your planning.  The plan can be in any form you find  comfortable. Feel free to use tables, infographics, images, etc. However, you will need to be succinct and to the point. Marks will be deducted for overly lengthy or wordy planning sections.   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – plan the steps to ensure your data is clean and wellunderstood.   Feature selection – plan to extract the correct features to train a good model.  You can use things such as P values for backward and forward elimination.  Train model – plan the hyperparameters you will use to train the model.   Interpret and evaluate model \- plan the evaluation metrics you will use to interpret the results of your model.   Write a report – plan the report that you will need to submit to show your findings. This report should detail the outcomes of your EDA and data cleaning, basic information about the data, how the model was trained, and finally, how you ensured the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.   **Conduct your analysis:** You must demonstrate that you can conduct the study and fully understand the Python code you are using and your steps. You will do this by providing comments regarding your steps as you go.  EDA – conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis.   Feature selection – use any method you are comfortable with to select the best features to train your model.   Train model \- Train your model using your prepared dataset and chosen hyperparameters (you can also choose the default)      **Evaluate your model:**  Interpret and evaluate model \-   select and justify the performance metrics you will use to interpret your model scores and evaluate the success of the model.   |  |
|  | b. 	Retrain with different parameters (if necessary) – retrain the model and highlight the changes you made to address the shortcomings of your previous model.  |
| 5\.  | **Write and submit your report.**   a. 	 You need to create and submit a report that shows the client the steps you took to clean the  data, conduct your EDA (visualize the data for the customer, showing them patterns and other aspects important to know and for training your model), how the model was trained,  how the models results were interpreted and used to evaluate the model.   |
